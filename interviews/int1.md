## Interview with a Professional Email Bomber

*Philip: Can you explain exactly what the software does for those who might not be familiar?*

Placing: Essentially It Uses The Gmail Mailing servers to flood inboxes with emails at a much higher rate than competitors

*Philip: Without doxxing yourself can you give any background on your age or demographics?*

*Philip: If not that is ok too*

Placing: uh mixed race high schooler

*Philip: Do you consider yourself a hacker?*

Placing: nope

*Philip: but you're familiar with tools like openbullet and even created your own email bombing software, which you sell as a subscription service?*

Placing: just a coder

*Philip: how long have you been coding?*

Placing: 3 years

*Philip: what initially got you interested?*

Placing: uh idk i thought it was cool

*Philip: Do you remember your first project or language?*

Placing: skype tool in c#

*Philip: what did it do?*

Placing: spam calls auto respond etc

*Philip: nice haha*

*Philip: so I guess it's safe to say you've always been attracted to "the dark side"*

Placing: eh not really

*Philip: how long did it take before you started trying to make a profit from your skills?*

*Philip: Is Conbain email bomber your first venture in that sense?*

Placing: not really but its the first success

*Philip: What else have you tried?*

*Philip: Also (whenever you find time)*

*- What gave you the idea for Cobain email bomber?*
*- Has your userbase been growing with time?*

Placing: making sqli queries aka dorks
vpn clients
much more

people hated floodcrm.net
yes ive made almost 2k this month

Placing: at 16

*Philip: Wow, that's quite a bit. How long did it to work your way up to $2000/month in subscriptions/purchases?*

Placing: actually this is the first monthðŸ˜Œ

Placing: first purchase was made on 9/24/19

*Philip: Congratulations*

Placing: Thanks!

*Philip: So you've been working on Cobain for over a year now?*

*Philip: Did you always have the plan for a subscription model? Or did you create it for personal use originally?*

Placing: took me about 1-2 weeks if that

Placing: im not sure if it was 100% planned originally but it has been a part of the development since very early on

*Philip: can you cover some of the common motivations people have for email bombing?*

Placing: Messing With Friends, Removing Traces Of Activity WIth Accounts Linked To The email

*Philip: By removing traces you mean flooding someone's email at the same time someone uses an account attached to their email right? So if someone uses my Pizza Hut account to redeem a free pizza and I get an email I might miss it because I got 50 other emails.*

Placing: well in this case its way more than 50

*Philip: How many emails would I get hit with if you targetted me with Cobain?*

Placing: depends on the accounts 5 accounts can send around 300-400

*Philip: oh wow, so 300-400 emails from only 5 different email addresses?*

Placing: yess

*Philip: From what I've read the other main competitor is Flood CRM, can you compare Cobain to Flood CRM?*

*Philip: Flood CRM is like pay-as-you-go, where as Cobain is like all you can eat buffet kind of thing?*

Placing: floodcrm is overpriced and inconsistant

*Philip: what do you mean by inconsistant?*

Placing: in sending the emails u paid for

*Philip: How many email bombs would you have to use to save money by using Cobain instead?*

Placing: not that many as 7.50 for 1000 emails is standard with floodcrm and some have reported less than 10% of return

*Philip: ouch, and you mentioned 300-400 emails with 5 gmail accounts. One problem I imagine you might have with that, wouldn't the reciever just have to "mark as spam" 5 different times to clear their box?*

*Philip: What is the maximum amount of accounts you could send from?*

Placing: nope and 50

*Philip: 50 accounts that's pretty good, I imagine you'd be able to send well over 1000 emails to a target if you loaded Cobain with 50 accounts.*

*Philip: Do you have any last tips for people who want to get started with email bombing?*

Placing: way over 1000

Placing: buy my bomber ;)

*Philip: Of course! But anything beyond that? For example should people switch out the accounts every so often in case they get marked as spam?*

Placing: gmail has sending limits per time limit so they need to make burners

*Philip: So if I do a massive email bombing with 50 gmail accounts, is it good enough to come back a few days later or will those accounts be dead?*

Placing: they wont be dead

*Philip: thanks for your time*
