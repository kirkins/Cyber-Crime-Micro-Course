The lyrics in this song reference the rappers use of credit card fraud techniques.

*Go hire a hundred swipers so I can build me an empire
Hit 200 up the freeway in the Scat, I had to change tires
The Walmart system different, so I had to go inside Meijers
Scratch the numbers off a real credit card with car pliers*

Using them to build a criminal organization where he has "swipers" working under him, using cards which he produces.

*They thought I opened up a website, but it's just all a scandal
'Cause soon as you click the link, I get your information
He ordered a t-shirt three years ago and he still waiting
Got scammed by a Telegram admin and I'm still waiting*

In the same song we see a reference to owning a website that sells merchandise but is really used to obtain information about customers to commit financial fraud against them. He then references getting scammed on Telegram a popular chat application often used in CyberCrime.

*Just scammed my own fans, man, that shit is not cool
Bought a t-shirt off my website, nigga, you're a fool
Fire ass profile and it came with the fullz*

Another reference to a website selling merchandise where information is being used for financial fraud. Reference to *fullz* being the full information about a person.

*We can go BIN for BIN if it's beneficial*

A reference to credit card BINs. A BIN is the first four to six numbers which appear on a credit card.
