## Man in the Middle

A man in the middle attack (MiTM) is one in which the attacker positions himself inbetween a legitimate website and a client side user. It is one of the oldest forms of attack used on the internet.

As a website owner one of the best ways to protect against a MiTM attack is to simply make use of an SSL certificate and enforce HTTPS. This can be done using a program like LetsEncrypt to create a free SSL certificate or buying one from a certificate authority (CA).
