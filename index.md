## Cybercrime Mini-Course

This website is collection of my research related to cyber crime, dark markets, common attacks, and how to defend against them. It may be of interesting to groups including:

- Those interested in dark markets
- Those interested in hacking
- Security Researchers
- Social Researchers
- Those protecting against hacks, security, and social engineering attacks

It was originally created as a graduate course project as a reusable learning object (RLO), however I may continue to expand on the research after the semeter finishes.
